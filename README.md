how-long
========

I have $500 to invest. It costs me $10 per trade. How long will I have to keep my money in $RSP for the fees of getting it in and out to pay off? If I had invested it any day in the past ten years and pulled it out any day after, how likely would I be to make money?

## I want
* a bar chart, showing the number of days from investment and the average I would make pulling it out then.

## I can modify
* the stock pick.
* the amount of seed money.
* distribution between multiple stocks.

## It should be built with
* Python for the backend API
* Polymer for the frontend
* Highcharts for the charting
